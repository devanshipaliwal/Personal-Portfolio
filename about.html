                            I’m currently a first year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br><br>
        
                            The COVID - 19 pandemic brought a lot of hardship around the world, but it also gave me the time to learn and familiarize myself with the world of UI/UX design. Since stumbling upon the term in 2020, I have worked as a UI/UX design Intern at Statflo and continued to grow as a designer through some projects of my own. <br><br> 
                            
                            Outside of design, I love to keep myself busy. You can usually find me reading a good fantasy book, watching hockey, or rock climbing. <br><br>
                            
                            <strong>Some fun facts about me - </strong><br><br>

                            I’ve been an avid Toronto Maple Leafs fan for years now. It’s painful at times, but I wouldn’t change a thing. <br><br>
                            
                            I once spent an entire week reading an ~4000 page book series. Seriously - 9am to 1am straight, for 6 days. If you're curious, it was the Stormlight Archive series.<br><br>
                            
                            I love meeting new people, so feel free to reach out! Always happy to discuss the newest design trends, or recommend a good book :)<br><br>
